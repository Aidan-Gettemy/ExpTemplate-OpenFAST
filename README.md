# Template for OpenFAST Experimentation

This library provides a solution for managing experiments with the OpenFAST simulation tool [OpenFAST](https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast?tab=readme-ov-file) using MatLab.  This code is a general template, fit to be modified for many different experiments.

# Description:

This library/framework solves the problem faced when running numerical experiments with OpenFAST; changing the input files in the appropriate manner takes a lot of effort.  With a large number of inputs, selecting only those pertinent to a particular study is difficult.  This library is a flexible, DIY inspired approach for running experiments.  It separates the structuring of the experimental design and the analysis of the results from the editing of the input files.  It is modular, using many helper functions which can be adapted to handle any input file type, enabling this framework to apply to different turbine setups and experiment designs.

The heart of the library are two files.
- `ExpTableGenerator.m`
- `ExpDriver.m`

Once the user has configured these files (and the helper functions), running the experiment and organizing the results for further analysis is simple.  Simply run the `ExpTableGenerator.m` then run the `ExpDriver.m`.

This framework streamlines OpenFAST input-output handling, while keeping the data organized.  The user specifies an experiment to run by giving the input (independent) variables and settings for each test in the experiment as a tablematrix/table (each row is a different test, each column a different input).  Then the framework will set up and run the simulations required, organizing the outputs channels (dependent variables) requested by the user into a table that mirrors the input table provided.  The result is a data-folder and a table of outputs from the experiment, in the same row-order as the input table.

# Instructions:

Note: Requires:
- MatLab
- OpenFAST excecutable (adjust the path in the `testdriver.m` file)
- Properly compiled DLL file (see the ServoDyn file)

Before running scripts, first copy the ***`Template_IEA-15-240-RWT-Monopile` folder and rename it `Simulate`***.

Also, provide an **inflow wind** file to run tests on (and change `ExpTableGenerator.m` accordingly).

## Step by Step

Here we will explain how to go from desiging the input table, to modifying the helper functions, to handling how the outputs are organized into a final table.

### Step One: Table Generator 

The `ExpTableGenerator.m` file uses the selected OpenFAST inputs given to make an InputTable for each experiment.  The resulting table is saved as a text file and will be read by the `ExpDriver.m` script.  Each column represents an independent variable that will trigger a change in the files for OpenFAST to read.  Each test is a row of the table; a unique configuration of the inputs.  Taken together, all of the rows of the table will help to answer some question about wind turbine engineering.  Follow the comments within the table generator file in order to see where to make changes.

- Line 5: Determines the name of the experiment (must match the name given in `ExpDriver.m`)
- Line 16: The *invarNames* refer to the independent variables required settings in the experiment.  Some of them may simply be a part of the experimental set-up and not variables at all.  In the given example, `windfileID` is the name of the wind file to simulate on, and will not be included in analysis.  In future experiments, multiple wind files may be specified.
- Line 22: If wanted, the user can read in design points from another source and then do additional formating/manipulation in this file.
- Line 25: Determine the number of tests to be run.
- Line 27: This is the number of inputs (it could also be the number of independent variables).
- Line 46: We save the table to a text file.

### Step Two: How to Run a Simulation

The `ExpDriver.m` file takes the input table from `ExpTableGenerator.m` to set up and run OpenFAST tests.  The results will be found in a newly created Data folder in a sub-folder with the name given by the experiment's name.

- Line 8: This line sets the experiment name.  It must match the experiment name specified in line 5 of `ExpTableGenerator.m`.
- Line 10: This file name must match the template files for the desired OpenFAST experiment configuration (in this example the IEA-15-240-RWT-Monopile).
- Line 12: Set which row of the input table to start with and which row of the input table to stop after.  This allows for the same input table to be run in parallel on several CPUs at once.  (Though this would require additional post-processing to combine the results together at the end).
- Line 14: Set the number of seconds for each test.
- Line 16: Set the number of seconds from the end to start calculating things like mean, standard deviation, etc.
- Line 18: Set the test time step.
- Line 20: If true, then the `.out` file will be deleted to save memory.
- Line 22: If true, then the big result table (a copy of the time-series of each requested channel found in the `.out` file but as a text table) is deleted.
- Line 46: This is where the set-up begins, and where the OpenFAST executable is called.
- Line 50: Note, when running, this code generates a file that can be used to quickly access the contents of the experiment data subfolders.  This is helpful when performing quality checks or looking at results of individual runs.  It is also how this script creates the result folders and tables.
- Line 80: After the result tables for each test are made, then a list of output variables to be calculated is sent to the 'combineResults.m' function, which is found in the 'funcs' folder.  In this example, these are just names, but one could set these up as key words to automatically call different helper functions to explore different types of output analysis.
- Line 87: This line moves the statusFile to the experiment subfolder.

Now we can go in depth on some of the key helper functions to explain how they work and how they can be modified.

### Step Three: Set-Up Function

In the next steps, all of the named functions are found in the `funcs` folder.

The `setup.m` function updates the OpenFAST files according to the experiment.  Each row of the input table is extracted and taken as in input to the `setup.m` function.  This function also takes as an input a small set of auxiliary variables.  In this example, those are the file location of the template folder, the current test number, the duration of each test (in seconds), the time step (in seconds), the id for status file, the test number, and the name of the experiment.  This can be changed according to needs.  

This file has three main sections.  In the first section, a series of helper functions are called to set up various module input files and simulation parameters.  In the second section, the output channels are formated according to an included `OutputChannels.txt` file.  Finally, in the third section, the simulation is run through the `testdriver.m` function and the results are moved to the storage folder.  Meanwhile, a status file keeps track of the tests that have been run, and will serve as a tool for indexing the saved tests in the rest of the `ExpDriver.m` script.

### Step Four: Anatomy of a Helper Function 

In the first section of the included `setup.m` script, there are 5 subsections.
- First, the `make_readme,m' helper function is called.
- Second, the `chg_wnd.m` helper function is called.
- Third, the `make_fst.m` helper function is called.
- Fourth, the `chg_tower.m` helper function is called.
- Finally, the `chg_hydrodyn.m` helper function is called.

Each of these helper functions is similar and has the job of modifying one type of file for the simulation.  There is one file not needed for simulation, but should be changed and saved for each test; the README file is designed to document the inputs for a given test.  This file is modified and saved along with the results of the simulation in the test-specific data subfolder at the end of the experiment.  In this way, there is a unique README for each test.  This file can be found in the template directory.

The anatomy of a helper function is simple.  It takes as its input some portion of the current test row, and the location of the template file to be read in and the location of the resulting file to be saved to.

As an example, take `chg_tower.m`. 

- Line 5: We gather up all the lines from the template file into a cell.
- Line 9: Each line is split before it can be used.  Depending on the type of file/line being edited, different entries of the resulting string array need to be modified.  In this case, the tower properties being edited are the 4th and 5th entries.
- Line 15: The form vector establishes the text style that will be entered into the simulation directory.
- Line 16: The formats object takes as its parts the form vector, and an array with ones and zeros.  The ones correspond to entries in the form vector that will be replaced.
- Line 17: The edit_type cell takes sub-cells that have a simple form.  The number of subcells must match the dimension of the array in Line 9.  THe sub-cells have the form {"multiply/replace", value}.  The multiply trigger means that value will be multiplied by the entry found in the corresponding edit spot in the template file.  The replace trigger means that value will replace what was originally in that location.  Multiply only works with doubles.  Replace can be any entry.
- Line 18: In this line, we replace the ith entry of the data cell (which contains all of the lines of the original file), with the instructions on how to modify that line.  The last input to the `editor.m` helper function is a number (called the *flag*).  If *flag* equals 1, then the value (or multiply) if it is numeric, will be saved in scientific notation with 15 significant digits.  Otherwise, the value is saved with 4 significant digits, not in scientific form.
- Line 21: The modified data cell is printed to the correct location in the simulation directory.  We are good to go.

As demonstrated above, the helper functions make use of a few basic functions.  These are:
- `gather_up.m`: takes a fileID and returns a cell of all of its lines.
- `lay_down.m`: take a cell made up of file lines and saves a text file to a specific location.
- `editor.m`: this function is the very center of the text-editing scheme that is the true objective of this entire library.  Everything about this library is directed to set up this function to change the text to enable different test settings.

### Step Five: Output Channel Control

This is the second section of the `setup.m` function.

This is run through `outputfunc.m`.  This function allows us to modify the output channels that we want to look at.  For this to work, the output sections at the end of each of the OpenFAST files for the different included modules in the Template folder must be deleted and moved to the output channel file with the particular set-up as seen in `OutputChannels.txt`.  If this recipe isn't followed (that is the 1001 included to delieanted between each section) then the code fails.  When this script runs, it appends each of these sections to the proper files in the simulate folder.  Adding and deleting channels is done on the `OutputChannels.txt` file.  The inputs to this function are the first part of the file ID for the simulate folder.  The cell of file ids is needed to correctly access each module file.  We need to know the location of the Output.txt file.  And last, we need to know the line where the output section begins for each module file.  

### Step Six: Setting up the Driver

This is the part of the `setup.m` function where the simulation actually takes place.  In the `testdriver.m` file, line 8 needs to point to the OpenFAST executable that you use.  Line 11 must point to the correct folder for where the .fst file will be.  Note, for different tests, the `move_clean.m` function might need to be adjusted so that it moves the required output files to the data folder for each test.  

Returning to the `setup.m` function, everything else deals with filling in the statusFile as the experiment progresses.  This file has many purposes.  It can be used to restart the experiment if a simulation crashed.  It can be used to index into the data folders conveniently.  It is needed for the data-table construction process.  If this framework is followed, the user does not need to change any lines after line 68.


### Step Seven: Setting up the Parameters of the Result Table

Back in the `ExpDriver.m` script, there are two more functions to address.  First, in line 58 we call the `resultfunc.m` helper function.  Since this function is called in a loop over the lines of the statusFile, that means we are accessing files that have been moved to the data folder.  The `resultsfunc.m` function calls two basic functions.  The first, `create_mat_files.m`, will make a table version of the `.out` file and will save the names of all of the outputs, as well as their units into a `.mat` file (cell).  The second, `create_sum_table.m` is more complicated.  This makes a table, where each row is given the name of one of the output channels.  Each column is some sort of statistic derived from the time series.  In this example, those statics are the mean and the standard deviation.  Note that additional attributes could be calculated (like frequencies), and, additional functions could be written to generate other types of time-series features.  If more features are added, line 30 will need to be modified, as well.  Note that all of these features need to be included in line 80 of the `ExpDriver.m` script.

Finally, when setting up the `combineResults.m` function, which is called in line 81 of `ExpDriver.m`, as long as the variable list corresponds with the features calculated in the `create_sum_table.m` function, then no lines need to be changed.  The resulting table will have both the input table, and the output feature value for each output channel/feature combination.  Each row of this table is a different test.  This is table is a convenient way of doing analysis on the experiment, or doing machine learning tasks, like training a Regression or classification algorithm.

Note, a few of the functions included in the `funcs` folder are not described thus far.  These are the plotting functions.
- `plot_ts.m`: This requires the variable names (as formattedd in the data-folders), and a table of time series data.
- `plot_multi.m`: Requires inputs, the table of time series data, the names (as formatted in the data-folders), and a table that gives what outputs to be plotted each other.

Additional functions should be written as needed, especially when seeking to expand the input available to be changed.  This might require some creativity for efficient indexing and modifying, but the existing functions are good blueprints.  The most common type of addaptation is in helper functions that set up the various module files.  The changes needed to adapt the summary tables are very slight.

Now we have gone through what each file does.  Hopefully this is clear enough to run and recreate the results of this experiment, and to adapt this framework for one's own experimental needs.

### Process for Running a new Experiment

- Run `ExpTableGenerator.m` to generate a table of inputs for each test.
- Run `ExpDriver.m` to set up the `Simulate` folder and run OpenFAST on each test, gathering up the results from all the tests into a data table, before moving the data table and the `StatusFile.txt` to the experiment folder within the `Data` folder.

Now the experiment is finished, and the results are organized for analysis.

# Example: Morris Method Applied with 4 Inputs

THis repository contains code to perform the Morris Method of global sensitvity analysis.  Follow the these steps to recreate results.
1. Run `ExpTableGenerator.m`
2. Run `ExpDriver.m`
3. Run ONLY the second section and beyond within `MorrisMethod.iypn`.  Follow the comments to make changes to look at different outputs.  If the user wants to run the `MorrisMethod.iypn` code to generate new Morris Method points, then the first section should be run, then run steps **1 - 3**.

### Explanation of the `MorrisMethod.iypn` code and this tower sensitivity experiment. 

The goal of this example library is to explore the sensitivity of a large number of output channels (the mean and standard deviation of their time series) simulated from a turbulent wind file (not included in this library, but it could be any such file configured for this turbine model) to 4 different inputs.  Those inputs are as follows: the fore-aft stiffness of the tower in the first node, the side-side stiffness of the tower in the first node, the wave height, and the wave direcition.  These independent variables are varied in the following ranges:
- FA: up to 10% reduction
- SS: up to 10% reduction
- wave height: 10% change plus/minus around 1.1 m
- wave dir: from -10 degrees to 10 degrees.
Information about the Morris Method can be found in this article: Cropp, Roger A., and Roger D. Braddock. "The new Morris method: an efficient second-order screening method." Reliability Engineering & System Safety 78, no. 1 (2002): 77-83.

Now, in the `MorrisMethod.iypn` file, the first section generates the Morris points.  We outline the structure of the problem first.  Then we set a number of potential trajectories to generate (100).  We decide to partition each input range into 6 sections.  Then we choose 10 trajectories optimally.  This means that we will need to run (4+1)*10 total simulations.  

The output from this section is a text file that is an input to 'ExpTableGenerator.m`.  After we run this MatLab script, we run the 'ExpDriver.m` file (as described in all of the above instructions).  The end result is a final table that has each output channel (means and standard deviations).  This output file is loaded in along with the Morris points.  

The fourth code-block is the most important to explain.  
- Line 1: Select the desired output to observe
- Line 11: Set up the SALib Morris object.
- Line 33: The top 3 inputs (measured by Euclidean distance from the origin in the (mu_star, sigma) plane) are printed out.
- Line 38: Below this is all formatting for the plot.

The output is explained below:
First, the name of the output we selected.
A table of the Morris Results.
The top three inputs.
The plot: On the right, the legend delinated by shapes and colors.  The x axis is the mu_star value and the sigma value is on the y axis.
